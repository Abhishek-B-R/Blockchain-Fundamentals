# Consensus Algorithm

#### Since there is no centralized authority, the network relies on a consensus algorithm to agree on the state of the blockchain.

## By using Consensus Algorithm, we need to solve 3 major problems:
- **Sybil Attack**: In blockchain we have thousands of nodes which have to come to an agreement on the state of the blockchain. But what if one single node brings a lot of fake nodes to the network? This can lead to a situation where the network is controlled by a single entity, which can lead to censorship and other forms of manipulation. The way blockchain solves this is by using Sybil Resistance mechanisms such as **Proof of Work (PoW)** or **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
- **Finality**: Once a block is added to the blockchain, it should be impossible to change it. This is important because it ensures that the blockchain is immutable and cannot be tampered with. The problem is how long to wait before we can be sure that the block will not be changed. This is called **Finality**.
- **Consensus problem**: How do we get all the computers to agree on the state of the blockchain? This is called the **Consensus Problem**.


## Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use different consensus algorithms to solve these problems.
## Bitcoin uses Proof of Work (PoW) while Ethereum uses Proof of Stake (PoS).

## **Bitcoin** makes participating in the network expensive through computational work. You can create lots of identities, lots of nodes but you can't fake the electricity bill. This is called **Proof of Work (PoW)**.

## **Ethereum** makes participating in the network expensive through requiring stake. This is money they have to lock up in order to participate in the network. You can create multiple nodes but you can't fake having all of that money locked up. Also you will lose all of your money if you try to cheat. This is called **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.


# **Consensus Algorithms** has a part of it called **Sybil Resistance Mechanisms** which has 2 types called **Proof of Work (PoW)** and **Proof of Stake (PoS)**.
