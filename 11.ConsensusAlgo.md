# Consensus Algorithm

#### Since there is no centralized authority, the network relies on a consensus algorithm to agree on the state of the blockchain.

## By using Consensus Algorithm, we need to solve 3 major problems:
- **Consensus**: Ensure all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain.
- **Security**: Protect the network from malicious actors.
- **Scalability**: Handle a large number of transactions efficiently.
