# Ethereum Mainnet is L1 and zkSync is L2 Rollup.

# L1 Blockchain
Layer 1 is a blockchain in its purest form, where nodes contribute to sybil resistance and consensus. Also called as Settlement Layer. Ex: Bitcoin, Ethereum Mainnet, Solana.

# L2 Rollup Blockchain
Layer 2 is a blockchain that is built on top of Layer 1. It is used to reduce the cost of transactions and increase the throughput of the network. Ex: zkSync, Polygon, Arbitrum. For example, they increase the amount of transactions, without increasing the gas costs.



# The Blockchain Trilemma

## We need our Blockchain to be Decentralized, Scalable, and Secure. But we can't have all three at the same time. We need to choose two out of three. This is why we need L2 Rollups, they help to make L1 blockchain scale without compromising decentralization and security.


## But the drawback is that rollups don't know if a transaction is valid or not.  There are 2 types of rollups: Optimistic Rollups and Zero-Knowledge Rollups.

### **Optimistic Rollups** : Optimistic Rollups operate on the principle that all transactions in a batch are valid by defaultâ€”an "optimistic" assumption. After an L2 operator posts a batch to the L1, a Challenge Period begins, which typically lasts about a week. During this window, any other network participant can scrutinize the batch. If they identify an invalid transaction, they can submit a Fraud Proof to the L1. This triggers a dispute resolution process on the L1 to verify the claim.

- ### If the fraud proof is successful: The fraudulent batch is reverted, and the malicious operator who submitted it is penalized by having their staked collateral slashed.

- ### If the challenge period ends without a successful challenge: The batch is considered final and is permanently recorded on the L1.

### The primary trade-off of this model is the long waiting period for transaction finality. Users must wait for the challenge period to conclude before they can withdraw their funds from the L2 back to the L1.



### **Zero-Knowledge Rollups** : Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups take a different approach. Instead of assuming validity and waiting for challenges, they proactively prove the validity of every transaction batch using advanced cryptography. When a ZK-Rollup operator submits a batch to the L1, they also generate and submit a cryptographic Validity Proof, specifically a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). This proof mathematically guarantees that all the state changes within the batch are correct and follow the network's rules.

### A smart contract on the L1, known as the Verifier, can instantly check this proof. If the proof is valid, the batch is accepted and finalized immediately. This eliminates the need for a lengthy challenge period, allowing for much faster withdrawals and finality compared to Optimistic Rollups.

### A key feature of the ZKPs used in most rollups is succinctness, meaning the proof is very small and fast to verify, even if it represents an immense amount of computation. For this reason, these are sometimes called Succinct Rollups.

### While most ZK-Rollups use this technology for scaling, some also leverage the "zero-knowledge" property to provide privacy, enabling secret balances and confidential transactions. These are often called ZK-ZK Rollups, with Aztec being a prominent example.
