# Understanding Centralized vs. Decentralized Exchanges (CEXs vs. DEXs)

In the previous lesson, we explored different types of crypto tokens, focusing on fungible tokens. These fall into two main categories:
- **Native tokens** like **ETH** on Ethereum, which are built into a blockchain’s protocol.
- **ERC20 tokens**, which are created by smart contracts on top of a blockchain.

This raises a key question: **How do you acquire and trade these tokens?**
If you want to swap ETH for a stablecoin like USDC or buy a governance token, you need a **marketplace** — an **exchange**.

In Web3, exchanges are broadly divided into two types:
- **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)**
- **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**

Understanding their differences is crucial for navigating the crypto ecosystem safely and effectively.

## Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

Centralized exchanges are **private companies** that act as trusted intermediaries for buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrencies.
They are the digital equivalent of a **stock brokerage or bank**.

**Examples:** Coinbase, Binance.

### How CEXs Work

1. **Create an Account:** Sign up using an email and password.
2. **Complete KYC:** Verify your identity with documents like a passport or driver’s license.
3. **Deposit Funds:** Transfer fiat (USD, EUR, etc.) from your bank account onto the exchange.

When you deposit funds, you **transfer control of your assets** to the exchange — they hold your crypto and **control the private keys**.
This is summed up by the saying:
> “Not your keys, not your coins.”

CEXs typically use an **order book system**, matching buy and sell orders through a centralized system.

### Advantages of CEXs

- **Speed and Liquidity:** Fast execution and deep liquidity enable large trades with minimal price impact.
- **User Experience:** Polished, beginner-friendly interfaces.
- **On-Ramps and Off-Ramps:** The main bridge between fiat and crypto worlds — allowing conversion between the two.

### Disadvantages of CEXs

- **Custodial Risk:** You rely on the exchange’s solvency and security.
  - If hacked, insolvent, or frozen, your funds can be lost.
  - The **FTX collapse** is a prime example of this risk.

## Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)

Decentralized exchanges are **protocols built on smart contracts** that enable **peer-to-peer trading** without intermediaries.
They run **directly on the blockchain**.

### How DEXs Work

1. **No Account or KYC:** Access is **permissionless**; no personal data required.
2. **Connect Your Wallet:** Interact by connecting a self-custody wallet like **MetaMask**.
3. **Trade Directly:** Execute trades **from your wallet** — your assets remain under your control.

**Core principle:** **Self-custody.**
You hold your private keys and maintain full control of your tokens at all times.

### The AMM Model (Automated Market Maker)

Most modern DEXs, such as **Uniswap**, use **AMMs** instead of order books.
Trades occur through **liquidity pools** — smart contracts that hold reserves of two or more tokens.

- **Liquidity Providers (LPs)** deposit equal values of tokens to create these pools.
- Traders swap tokens **with the pool**, not directly with another user.
- Prices are determined automatically by a **mathematical formula** based on the token ratios in the pool.

Example:
If users buy ETH from an ETH/USDC pool, ETH supply decreases, making ETH more expensive relative to USDC.

### Examples of DEXs and Tools

- **Uniswap:** The largest DEX for ERC20 token trading.
- **Curve:** Optimized for stablecoin swaps with minimal slippage.
- **Balancer:** Allows multi-token pools with customizable weights.
- **1inch / Matcha:** DEX aggregators that find the best trade routes across multiple DEXs.

### Risks of DEXs

- **Smart Contract Risk:** Vulnerabilities in the code can be exploited.
  - Reputable DEXs mitigate this through **security audits** by firms such as **Cyfrin**.

## Conclusion

Both **CEXs** and **DEXs** are essential tools in crypto trading.

| Feature | Centralized Exchange (CEX) | Decentralized Exchange (DEX) |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Custody | Exchange holds your funds | You hold your funds (self-custody) |
| KYC Required | Yes | No |
| On/Off Ramps | Yes | No |
| Trade Speed | High | Moderate (blockchain-dependent) |
| Risks | Custodial, insolvency, hacks | Smart contract vulnerabilities |
| Control | Exchange | User |

**Summary:**
- CEXs provide **ease of use** and **fiat access**, but carry **custodial risk**.
- DEXs offer **self-custody** and **permissionless trading**, but require technical competence and come with **smart contract risk**.
