# There are multiple types of blockchains, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases.

## There are mainly 2 types, Layer1 and Layer2 blockchains.

* ### Layer1 blockchains are the foundation of the blockchain ecosystem, providing the basic infrastructure for decentralized applications. They are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the network and ensuring the security of transactions. Ex: Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana

* ### Layer2 blockchains are built on top of Layer1 blockchains and aim to improve scalability and efficiency. They use various techniques such as sharding, state channels, and sidechains to achieve this goal. Ex: Optimism, Polygon, Arbitrum, zkSync


### Mainnet and Testnet blockchains are the primary types of blockchain networks. Mainnet blockchains are the live, production-ready versions of a blockchain, while Testnet blockchains are used for testing and development purposes. Ex: Ethereum Mainnet, Bitcoin Mainnet, Solana Mainnet, Optimism Mainnet, Polygon Mainnet, Arbitrum Mainnet, zkSync Mainnet, Ethereum Testnet, Bitcoin Testnet, Solana Testnet, Optimism Testnet, Polygon Testnet, Arbitrum Testnet, zkSync Testnet

### We can get these testnet currencies from Faucets (For Ethereum currently its Sepolia Testnet)

## Chain Ids
All blockchains have chainids, which are unique identifiers used to distinguish between different blockchain networks. These chainids are used in various applications and protocols to ensure that transactions are routed to the correct network. For example, the Ethereum mainnet has a chainid of 1, while the Ethereum testnet has a chainid of 5.

Chain Ids are always unique.
