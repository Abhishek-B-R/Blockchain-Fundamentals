# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
#### It is a bit like an Operating System for smart contracts.

EVM is just like a computer inside of Ethereum that knows how to run smart contract code. It is responsible for executing the code of smart contracts and maintaining the state of the blockchain.

### A common analogy is that Smart Contracts are the recipes for cooking, and the EVM is the kitchen where they are prepared and served. And the validators are the chefs who ensure that the food is cooked correctly and served to the right people.

Two types, EVM compatible and EVM equivalent.
