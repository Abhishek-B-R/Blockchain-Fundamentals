# Blockchain was firstly popularised by Bitcoin.

### Bitcoin white paper was created in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto.It showed how bitcoin could make peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority.
### People took to this as a superior digital asset, as a digital gold. Similar to gold, bitcoin is scarce and has a limited supply.


### Some people took it a even further, a person named Vitalik Buterin, created Ethereum. He released the Ethereum white paper in 2013.
### In 2015 him and his team released the first version of the Ethereum blockchain. Where people can not only make decentralized transactions but also create decentralized agreements. Which had no centralized authority.


# Smart Contracts
Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary. They come to life on these Blockchains.


### This is a biggest differentiator between Ethereum protocol and Bitcoin protocol.

## Bitcoin also has smart contracts but are intentionally limited in scope.
The reason for this is because Bitcoin developers viewed Bitcoin as a store of value. Versus Ethereum developers viewed Ethereum as both a store of value and a platform for decentralized agreements.

## Now these smart contracts are incredible, if we want these to replace the agreements in our everyday lives, they are gonna need data from the real world.
### Blockchains themselves can't interact or listen to data in real world, This is known as Oracle problem. Blockchains are deterministic systems. They are deterministic on purpose.

# Oracle
A blockchain oracle is any device or entity that connects  a deterministic blockchain with off-chain data.
If we want our applications to be truely decentralized, we can't work with a single oracle, a single source of truth. We need to have a decentralized oracle network.

Combining this onchain decentralized logic with offchain decentralized data is called as Hybrid Decentralized Application (HybDA).
And most of biggest protocols we interact with today, are hybrid to some extent.

## Chainlink is the most popular and powerful decentralized oracle network. And it is also Blockchain agnostic.


## Over the last few years, a new term has come to life called L2 or layer 2 scaling solutions. Currently there are 2 types of them, optimistic rollups and zero-knowledge rollups.

## Common Terms:

### Blockchain: In web3, a blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a secure and decentralized manner. Each block contains a number of transactions, and every new block is linked to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes the data tamper-resistant. Example: Bitcoin's blockchain records all BTC transactions.

### Oracle: Oracles in web3 are intermediaries that provide smart contracts with external data. They act as bridges between blockchains and the outside world, allowing smart contracts to execute based on real-world events and data. Example: A weather oracle provides data for a smart contract that triggers crop insurance payments based on rainfall data.

### Layer 2: Layer 2 solutions in web3 are technologies built on top of a blockchain (Layer 1) to improve its scalability and efficiency. These solutions handle transactions off the main chain, reducing congestion and fees, and then settle the final state on the main chain. Example: The Lightning Network for Bitcoin.

### Dapp (Decentralized Application): A Dapp is an application that runs on a decentralized network, typically a blockchain. It is powered by smart contracts and operates without a central authority. Dapps can serve various purposes, from finance to gaming. Example: Uniswap, a decentralized finance application.

### Smart Contract: In web3, a smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on blockchains and automatically execute when predetermined conditions are met, without the need for intermediaries. Example: A smart contract for an escrow service.

### Hybrid Smart Contract: Hybrid smart contracts combine on-chain code (running on a blockchain) with off-chain data and computations provided by oracles. This allows the contracts to interact with data and systems outside their native blockchain. Example: A smart contract for insurance that uses real-world data (like weather or flight delays) provided by oracles.

### Ethereum/EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine): Ethereum is a blockchain platform known for its smart contract functionality. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is its computation engine that executes smart contracts. Ethereum allows developers to build decentralized applications and is the basis for many web3 projects. Example: ERC-20 tokens, a standard for creating fungible tokens on Ethereum.

## Web3
Web3 is a term used to describe the new paradigm of the internet powered by blockchain and smart contracts. Unlike the previous versions of the web, web3 is permissionless and relies on decentralized networks rather than centralized servers. This ushers in an era of censorship-resistant and transparent agreements and transactions, often called an ownership economy.

### Web1: The permissionless open sources web with static content

### Web2: The permissioned web, with dynamic content where companies run your agreements on their servers.

### Web3: The permissionless web with dynamic content.

Decentralized censorship resistant networks run your agreements and code.

User owned ecosystems where one owns a portion of the protocol they interact with - instead of solely being the product
