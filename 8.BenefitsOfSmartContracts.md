# Benefits of Smart Contracts

- ### Decentralized - No single point of control/failure (If bank goes down in centralized system then ur screwed but in Blockchain even if thousands of computers go down, ur smart contract is still running as long as there is one node left)
- ### Transparent - All transactions are recorded on the blockchain and can be verified by anyone. You can also see the code of the smart contract and verify that it is doing what it is supposed to do. No hidden fees or no fine print. And change in rules as Smart Contracts are immutable once deployed (In traditional system, hidden fees and rules changes are common)
- ### Immutable - Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures that the terms of the contract are always enforced, even if the parties involved change their minds or go out of business.
- ### Sudo-Anonymous - Smart contracts can be executed without revealing the identities of the parties involved, providing a level of privacy and security that is not possible with traditional contracts.
- ### Speed and Efficiency - Smart contracts can be executed automatically and instantly, without the need for intermediaries or manual intervention. This reduces the time and cost associated with traditional contracts and allows for faster and more efficient transactions.
- ### Availability - Smart contracts are always available and accessible, even if the parties involved are not online or available. This ensures that the terms of the contract are always enforced, even if the parties involved change their minds or go out of business. No holidays, weekends, or other interruptions.
- ### Trust-minimized - Smart contracts are designed to be trust-minimized, meaning that they are built to be as secure and reliable as possible. This reduces the risk of fraud and other forms of abuse, and ensures that the terms of the contract are always enforced.


## Upgradable Smart Contracts

Smart contracts can be upgraded to fix bugs or add new features without affecting existing transactions. This ensures that the terms of the contract are always enforced, even if the parties involved change their minds or go out of business. The older contract points to new smart contract address.

## Hacking

To hack a traditional system, you have to hack into one server, but to hack into a Blockchain, u need to take control of more than half of the network. This is also called as 51% attack. It has never successfully been done on Bitcoin or Ethereum till now.
