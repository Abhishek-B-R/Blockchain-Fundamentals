# An Introduction to Blockchain Tokens

Understanding tokens is fundamental to navigating the web3 and blockchain industry. They are a core component of the ecosystem, forming the basis for everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to digital art. Common examples like **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** and **ERC20 tokens** are just two types within a vast and powerful category of digital assets.

At its core, a **token** is a digital representation of value or utility that exists on a blockchain. These programmable assets are managed by **smart contracts** and can represent:

- **Currency:** A medium of exchange within a network.
- **Ownership Rights:** Proof of ownership over a digital or physical asset.
- **Voting Power:** The right to participate in the governance of a protocol.
- **Access:** A key to unlock specific services or features.

Most tokens adhere to technical standards such as **Ethereum’s ERCs (Ethereum Request for Comments)**, ensuring predictable behavior and seamless interaction with wallets, exchanges, and dApps.

## The Core Types of Blockchain Tokens

Tokens can be categorized into several types, each with distinct characteristics, use cases, and technical standards.

---

### 1. Native Tokens

**Definition:**
Native tokens are the primary currency of a specific blockchain. They are not created by smart contracts but are integral to the blockchain’s core protocol.

**Key Characteristics and Use Cases:**

- **Paying Gas Fees:** Used to compensate validators or miners for processing transactions.
- **Interacting with Protocols:** Serve as the default currency for payments and trading.
- **Network Security:** Staked in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) systems to secure the network.
- **Governance:** Grant voting power on protocol upgrades and network proposals.

**Examples:**

- **ETH** – Ethereum
- **BTC** – Bitcoin
- **SOL** – Solana

### 2. Fungible Tokens

**Definition:**
Fungible tokens are interchangeable and divisible. Each unit holds identical value and function, like traditional currency.

**Standard:**
On Ethereum, most use the **ERC20** standard.

**Common Types:**

- **Stablecoins:** Maintain a stable value (e.g., **USDC**, pegged 1:1 to USD).
- **Utility Tokens:** Provide access to services (e.g., **LINK** for Chainlink oracles).
- **Governance Tokens:** Offer voting rights in DAOs (e.g., **UNI** for Uniswap).
- **Reward Tokens:** Earned by participating in protocols, such as liquidity provision.

### 3. Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

**Definition:**
NFTs are unique, non-interchangeable digital assets, each with distinct identity and metadata.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Unique:** Each token is verifiably different.
- **Non-Interchangeable:** Cannot be swapped 1:1 like fungible tokens.
- **Indivisible:** Cannot be divided into smaller units.
- **Metadata:** Describes attributes like name, description, and associated files.

**Standard:**
**ERC721** (most common on Ethereum).

**Use Cases:**

- **Digital Art:** Ownership proof (e.g., CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club).
- **ENS Domains:** Human-readable wallet names (e.g., `yourname.eth`).
- **In-Game Assets:** Virtual land or characters in blockchain games.

---

### 4. Semi-Fungible Tokens (SFTs)

**Definition:**
A hybrid between fungible and non-fungible tokens. Identical copies exist within a class, but each is uniquely owned and tracked.

**Standard:**
**ERC1155**

**Use Cases:**

- **Event Tickets:** Multiple copies for each event tier (e.g., General Admission vs. VIP).
- **In-Game Items:** Identical consumables like health potions.
- **Token Gating:** Tiered access to services or content.
- **Certifications:** Academic or professional credentials issued to many users.

---

### 5. Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs)

**Definition:**
The process of representing physical or financial assets as blockchain tokens, bridging **TradFi** and **DeFi**.

**Examples of Tokenized Assets:**

- Real Estate
- US Treasury Bonds
- Gold
- Private Equity

**Benefits:**

- **Increased Accessibility:** Fractional ownership of illiquid assets.
- **Improved Tradability:** 24/7 global markets.
- **Greater Efficiency:** Fewer intermediaries, lower costs, faster settlements.

## A Deeper Look at Stablecoins

Stablecoins provide stability in the volatile crypto market and serve as a bridge between fiat and DeFi.

**Main Types:**

1. **Fiat-Backed Stablecoins**
   - Backed 1:1 by fiat reserves (e.g., **USDC**, **USDT**).
   - Centralized; issuers can freeze assets under legal orders.

2. **Crypto-Backed Stablecoins**
   - Collateralized by cryptocurrencies locked in smart contracts.
   - Over-collateralized for volatility protection.
   - Decentralized (e.g., **DAI**).

3. **Algorithmic Stablecoins**
   - Use algorithms to control supply and maintain price pegs dynamically.

---

## How to Acquire and Trade Tokens

**Two primary venues exist:**

1. **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):**
   - Examples: **Coinbase**, **Binance**
   - Custodial, order-book based trading systems.

2. **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):**
   - Examples: **Uniswap**, **Curve**
   - Peer-to-peer trading via smart contracts, non-custodial and transparent.

**Summary:**
Blockchain tokens represent programmable units of value, utility, or ownership. From native tokens that power blockchains to NFTs that prove digital ownership, tokens underpin nearly every application in the web3 ecosystem.
