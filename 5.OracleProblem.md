# Oracle Problem

## Blockchains are good at handling data that is immutable and verifiable, but they are not good at handling data that is dynamic and unpredictable. This is where oracles come in.

### For example, there is a smart contract that provides funds to the house owners if their house was flooded, but how will Blockchains know if it actually flooded? Since the real world is unpredictable, we need to rely on external sources to provide this information. This is where oracles come in.
(As same input gives same output in Blockchains, anybody can misuse this behaviour by providing false information)

### Like this Blockchains might need so many other real world data like Stock pricing, weather data, sports scores, and more. Oracles can provide this data to the blockchain in a secure and reliable way, allowing smart contracts to make decisions based on real-world events.

## Oracle is a service or device that delivers data to these decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. It acts as a bridge between the blockchain and the real world, enabling the exchange of information and facilitating the execution of smart contracts based on real-world events.

### But we can't trust a centralized system to provide us real-world data, as someone can manipulate the data to their advantage. This is where decentralized oracles come in. Decentralized oracles are networks of nodes that are incentivized to provide accurate and reliable data to the blockchain. They use a variety of techniques to ensure the integrity of the data, such as proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, cryptographic hashing, and multi-signature verification.

## This decentralized oracle network is also called as DON (Decentralized Oracle Network).
### Here we have multiple oracle nodes providing same data which is cross-checked and verified by other nodes in the network. And then a conclusion is derived from the data provided by the nodes. This conclusion is then used by the smart contract to make decisions based on real-world events.

## Such blockchains with DONs are called as hybrid Blockchains. Most big web3 protocols use hybrid blockchains.

## Smart contract and hybrid smart contracts are often used interchangeably. One of such DONs is Chainlink, which is a decentralized oracle network that provides real-world data to smart contracts on various blockchains. Chainlink uses a variety of techniques to ensure the integrity of the data, such as proof-of-stake consensus algorithms, cryptographic hashing, and multi-signature verification.



### Few examples of DONs like Chainlink are used:

- #### DeFi - For price information
- #### Sports - For sports scores
- #### Weather - For weather data
- #### Insurance - For insurance claims
- #### Gaming - For gaming data
