# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

## Decentralized finance is a financial system that operates on a decentralized network, such as a blockchain, without the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. It enables users to access financial services and assets directly, without the need for a central authority or third-party approval.

### DeFi encompasses all protocols, services and applications that allow you to interact with money in decentralized systems. It's a new financial system built from ground up using blockchain technology and smart contracts. Here, we refer Traditional Finance (TradFi) as the financial system that operates on a centralized network, such as a bank or financial institution, with the need for intermediaries like banks or financial institutions. It enables users to access financial services and assets indirectly, with the need for a central authority or third-party approval.

## DeFi can do anything that TradFi can do, but it leverages blockchain technology for decentralization, transparency, and security. It enables users to access financial services and assets directly, without the need for a central authority or third-party approval. It is permissionless, immutable, transparent, and decentralized.



### TradFi is permissioned, you need a bank account, which requires an address, identification and approval from the bank. Companies can deny loans, and users can be subject to credit checks and other restrictions. DeFi is permissionless, you can access financial services and assets directly, without the need for a central authority or third-party approval. It is permissionless, immutable, transparent, and decentralized.

### TradFi is opaque, we don't know what's happening behind the scenes. DeFi is transparent, you can see everything that's happening on the blockchain. It is permissionless, immutable, transparent, and decentralized.

## Since DeFi has entirely coded, if you meet the requirements, you get the loan. No human bias, no terms that change, no bureaucracy. Some example DeFi applications are:
- ### **Decentralized Exchanges** : Trade tokens for other tokens, swap assets, and more. Ex: Uniswap, Curve, SushiSwap
- ### **Lending Platforms** : Borrow and lend assets, earn interest, and more. Ex: Aave, Compound, MakerDAO
- ### **Yield Farming** : Earn rewards by providing liquidity to liquidity pools or by participating in their ecosystems. Ex: PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, Curve
- ### **Asset Management** : Manage your assets, earn interest, and more. Ex: Yearn Finance, Balancer, Curve
