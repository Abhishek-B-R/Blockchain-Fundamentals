# Signatures

## There are 2 types of Signature
- **Public Key**
- **Private Key**

### **Private Key** is like a stamp that you use to sign your name on a document. It's a secret code that only you know, so no one else can use it to sign your name.

### **Public Key** is like a mailbox address. Its safe to share with others, so they can verify your signature. But they can't use it to steal ur funds or sign documents on your behalf.

## These two keys are mathematically linked together. If you have the private key, you can create a signature. If you have the public key, you can verify the signature. But knowing your public key doesn't give you the private key, and vice versa.

### **Wallet address** is just a hashed version of your public key. It's a unique identifier that represents your wallet on the blockchain. You can share your wallet address with others to receive funds, but you should never share your private key with anyone. It's just like a nickname that identifies you on the internet.

When we click confirm to a Transaction in our wallet (Metamask or Phantom), we are using our private key to sign the transaction. The blockchain then verifies this signature using the public key associated with our wallet address. This verification is done through a complex mathematical algorithm called as ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm).



# Your seed phrase are the most important thing to keep safe. If anybody gets access to it then they can regenerate all your private keys and steal your funds. So never share your seed phrase with anyone, and keep it in a safe place.

# Generate a seed phrase, and then create as many accounts(private keys) as you want. Then create their public keys. Then create their wallet addresses.

- Seed phrase is used to create private keys using some complex math.
- The private keys are then used to create public keys using ECDSA(Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to ensure its just one way, nobody can re-create public keys from private keys.
- Then we create wallet address by using a simple procedure - remove the first 2 characters from the public key. Copy the rest of the public key along with 0x prefix and hash it using keccak256 algorithm. The resulting hash's last 40 characters is your wallet address.
