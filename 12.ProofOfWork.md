# Proof of Work (PoW)

#### So for proof of work, the validators need to solve a complex mathematical problem that requires a lot of computational power. This problem is designed to be difficult to solve but easy to verify. The first validator to solve the problem gets to add the next block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency. This process is called mining.

## You can simulate and see how it works on [this link](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/block).
### In this website, the complex mathematical problem is to find a number that when hashed with the previous block's hash and the current block's data, the resulting hash starts with a certain number of zeros. This number of zeros is called the difficulty and is adjusted to keep the average time between blocks constant.


## A blockchain's one single block contains various sections like - Block no., Nonce, Data or Transactions, Previous Hash, Hash. All these blocks are connected to each other through their hashes, forming a chain. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, which ensures that the chain is immutable and tamper-proof.


### If anyone changes a single character in the data or the nonce, the hash will change, and the block will no longer be valid. This ensures that the blockchain is tamper-proof and secure.
### If we do have to change any block in the blockchain, we need to recalculate the hash of that block and all the blocks that follow it. This is because each block contains a hash of the previous block, which ensures that the chain is immutable and tamper-proof.

## The calculation of hash to match the provided conditions is called as Mining, which shows Proof of Work.

# **Ethereum** runs another hashing algorithm other than SHA-256, which is called Keccak-256.
# **Hash** is a unique fixed length string meant to identify a block in the blockchain.
# **Hash algorithm** is a mathematical function that takes an input and produces a fixed-length output, which is used to identify a block in the blockchain.
# **Mining** is the process of finding a hash that meets certain conditions, which is used to secure the blockchain and prevent tampering. Nodes get paid for mining the blocks.
# A **block** in a blockchain is a collection of transactions that are verified and added to the blockchain. Each block contains a hash of the previous block, which ensures that the chain is immutable and tamper-proof.
# **Nonce** is a number that is used to make the hash unique. It is a random number that is added to the block's data before hashing. It is used to find a hash that meets certain conditions. Nonce means "number used once" in this context.



# The miner who solves the Proof of Work problem gets to add his block to the blockchain and is rewarded with Ether (Usually the currency that blockchain uses).

# If 2 miners solve the Proof of Work problem at the same time, then this case is called as fork. In this case, the network will choose the longest chain as the valid chain and discard the shorter chain. If both chains are of equal length, the network will choose the chain that was created first. This is called longest chain rule.


# Finality in PoW
In PoW blockchains it's based on something called Confirmations. A confirmation happens each time a new block is added to the blockchain. The more confirmations a block has, the more secure it is. The network will wait for a certain number of confirmations before considering a transaction as final.

## After 6 confirmations the block is considered final and cannot be reversed. Because the probability of reversing a block decreases exponentially with each additional confirmation. This is known as the finality of the block.
