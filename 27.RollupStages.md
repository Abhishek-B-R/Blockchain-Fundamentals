# Understanding Rollup Stages: A Framework for L2 Maturity

Layer 2 scaling solutions, commonly known as **rollups**, are critical to Ethereum's future. To help users and developers navigate this complex ecosystem, a framework known as **"Rollup Stages"** was developed. Proposed by **Vitalik Buterin** and implemented by **L2BEAT**, this system categorizes rollups based on their level of **maturity and decentralization**.

> **Note:** These stages are **not a direct measure of security**. They represent a **roadmap** tracking a rollup‚Äôs evolution from a centrally managed system with ‚Äútraining wheels‚Äù to a fully trustless, decentralized protocol governed entirely by on-chain smart contracts.

You can track the stages of various projects on the **[L2BEAT scaling summary](https://l2beat.com/scaling/)** page.

## Stage 0: Full Training Wheels

Stage 0 represents the **earliest and most centralized** phase of a rollup‚Äôs lifecycle. The project depends on a trusted team of operators and a **Security Council** that can fix bugs, resolve issues, and push upgrades.

### Requirements

1. **Open-Source Data Reconstruction**
   - Rollup software must be open-source.
   - Anyone should be able to reconstruct the rollup‚Äôs state using data published on Layer 1 (L1).
   - Ensures transparency and verifiability.

2. **Limited User Exit**
   - In case of failure or unwanted upgrade, users have a short exit window (typically <7 days).
   - Withdrawal usually requires cooperation from the centralized operator.

## Stage 1: Enhanced Rollup Governance

A rollup reaches Stage 1 when it transitions key operations to **on-chain smart contracts**.
The Security Council still exists but plays a reduced role‚Äîmainly emergency bug fixes.

### Features

- **Operational Proof System**
  - A fully functional and decentralized **fraud-proof or validity-proof** system.
  - Any participant can permissionlessly challenge or verify state transitions on-chain.

- **Permissionless User Exit**
  - Users can withdraw funds **without operator approval**.
  - Exit window extends beyond 7 days.
  - Protects users from governance abuse or unwanted upgrades.

---

## Stage 2: No Training Wheels

Stage 2 marks **full decentralization and autonomy**. The rollup operates entirely through on-chain contracts with minimal human intervention.

### üîí Characteristics

- **Full Smart Contract Governance**
  - The rollup is completely managed on-chain.
  - No reliance on centralized operators.

- **Permissionless Proof System**
  - Anyone can participate in validation.
  - Proof system (fraud or validity) is entirely permissionless.

- **Limited Security Council**
  - Council powers restricted to on-chain adjudicated fixes only.
  - Prevents off-chain governance capture.

- **Ample Exit Window**
  - Users have significant time to exit before upgrades execute.
  - Ensures fund safety and user autonomy.

## Practical Example: zkSync Era (Stage 0 Risks)

**zkSync Era**, a leading ZK-rollup, is currently at **Stage 0**.
According to [L2BEAT‚Äôs risk assessment](https://l2beat.com/scaling/zkSync%20Era), risks are visualized across five key vectors:
üü¢ Low Risk | üü° Medium Risk | üî¥ High Risk

| **Risk Vector**        | **Color** | **Analysis** |
|--------------------------|------------|---------------|
| **Data Availability**    | üü¢ Green | zkSync Era posts **state diffs** to Ethereum L1. Anyone can reconstruct the state using this data. |
| **State Validation**     | üü¢ Green | Uses **ZK (Zero-Knowledge)** proofs with **PLONK** and **KZG** commitments to ensure correctness of transactions. |
| **Sequencer Failure**    | üü° Yellow | If the Sequencer halts or censors users, activity freezes. Users can queue transactions on L1 but cannot force inclusion. Funds safe but locked. |
| **Proposer Failure**     | üî¥ Red | Proposer role is **whitelisted**. If proposers fail, no new state roots are published ‚Üí withdrawals blocked. |
| **Exit Window**          | üî¥ Red | Smart contracts are **instantly upgradable** by governance entity. No delay for users to exit before upgrades. High user risk. |

### Summary

| **Stage** | **Description** | **Governance** | **User Exit** | **Proof System** |
|------------|------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **0** | Full training wheels | Centralized team & council | Limited (<7 days, permissioned) | Manual / partially on-chain |
| **1** | Enhanced governance | Hybrid (team + smart contracts) | Extended (>7 days, permissionless) | Decentralized |
| **2** | No training wheels | Fully on-chain | Fully permissionless, ample window | Fully permissionless |
