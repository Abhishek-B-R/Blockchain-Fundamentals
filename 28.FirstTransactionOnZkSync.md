# Your First Transaction on zkSync

Welcome to your guide to completing your first transaction on the **zkSync** network.
In this lesson, we’ll walk through getting **testnet funds** and **bridging** them from the **Sepolia testnet (L1)** to the **zkSync Sepolia testnet (L2)**.

> Note: The terms *zkSync Testnet*, *zkSync Sepolia*, and *zkSync Era Testnet* all refer to the same network in this guide.

## Step 1: Adding the zkSync Sepolia Network to MetaMask

Before interacting with zkSync, add its testnet configuration to MetaMask.

1. Go to [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org).
2. Enable **“Include Testnets”** (checkbox near the search bar).
3. Search for **zkSync**.
4. Locate **“zkSync Sepolia Testnet”** (ChainID: `300`) and click it.
5. Click **“Connect Wallet”** → approve MetaMask connection.
6. MetaMask will prompt you to **Add Network** → click **Approve**.
7. Click **“Switch network”** to make zkSync Sepolia active.

Your MetaMask should now display **0 ETH** on the **zkSync Sepolia Testnet**.

## Step 2: Using the zkSync Block Explorer

The **block explorer** allows you to inspect transactions, accounts, and contracts.

1. Visit the [zkSync Sepolia Testnet Explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
2. Copy your wallet address from MetaMask.
3. Paste it into the explorer’s search bar and press **Enter**.

You should see:
- 0 ETH balance
- No transaction history

You’ll return to this page later to verify your transaction.

## Step 3: Acquiring Testnet Funds

To perform transactions, you need ETH to cover gas fees.
We’ll use the **Ethereum Sepolia (L1)** testnet and later bridge funds to zkSync.

1. In MetaMask, switch to the **Sepolia Testnet**.
2. Go to a reliable faucet, e.g. [Google Cloud Ethereum Sepolia Faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia).
3. Paste your wallet address.
4. Complete verification (captcha, etc.) and request ETH.
5. Wait a few moments for **0.05 Sepolia ETH** to appear in your wallet.

## Step 4: Bridging Funds from Sepolia to zkSync Sepolia

### Understanding Bridging

**Bridging** moves assets between blockchains using smart contracts.
It doesn’t transfer tokens physically but mirrors them through one of two mechanisms:

- **Lock & Unlock**:
  Tokens are locked on L1 and unlocked on L2.
  zkSync’s native bridge uses this model.

- **Mint & Burn**:
  Tokens are burned on L1 and newly minted on L2 (e.g. Circle’s CCTP for USDC).

### Executing the Bridge Transaction

1. Go to the [zkSync Portal](https://portal.zksync.io/bridge/).
2. Ensure the top right corner shows **zkSync Sepolia Testnet**.
3. Click **“Connect wallet”** → approve MetaMask connection.
4. Verify bridge configuration:
   **From:** Ethereum Sepolia Testnet → **To:** zkSync Sepolia Testnet
5. Enter the amount to bridge (e.g. `0.025 ETH`).
6. Click **“Continue”**.
7. Acknowledge warnings → click **“I understand, proceed to bridge”**.
8. Review summary → click **“Bridge now”**.
9. MetaMask popup → click **“Confirm”**.

Once confirmed on Sepolia (L1), bridging begins automatically.

## Step 5: Verifying the Transaction and Understanding Finality

After a few minutes, your bridged ETH will appear in MetaMask when connected to **zkSync Sepolia**.

### Verify on the Explorer

1. Go back to the [zkSync Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
2. Search your wallet address again.

You should now see:
- Updated ETH balance
- Incoming transfer transaction

Click the transaction to view details (from L1 address → same L2 address).

---

## Understanding Finality on L1 vs L2

**Finality** = a transaction is permanent and irreversible.

### On Ethereum (L1)
- Achieved after ~13 minutes.
- Based on block confirmations.

### On zkSync (L2)
Two stages:

1. **Instant Confirmation (Processed)**
   - Transaction accepted almost instantly.
   - Funds usable immediately.
   - Status: *Processed*.

2. **Full Finality (on L1)**
   - zkSync submits a batch of L2 transactions to Ethereum.
   - Generates a ZK-proof verified on L1.
   - True finality once proof is validated.
   - Can take up to **24 hours**.

**Status progression:**
`Processed → Sending → Validating → Executing → Finalized`

## Summary

You have:
- Added zkSync Sepolia to MetaMask
- Used the zkSync explorer
- Claimed Sepolia testnet ETH
- Bridged ETH from Sepolia (L1) to zkSync Sepolia (L2)
- Verified your transaction and understood finality

You’re now ready to interact with zkSync dApps and perform L2 transactions.
