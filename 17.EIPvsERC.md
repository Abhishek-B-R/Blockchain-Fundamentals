# EIP vs ERC

# EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal):

### They are like formal documents that propose changes to the Ethereum protocol. They are written in a specific format and must be reviewed and approved by the Ethereum community before they can be implemented.

## Stages in EIP:

- Draft
- In Review
- Last Call
- Final

### ERC (Ethereum Request for Comments):

### They are like informal documents that propose changes to the Ethereum protocol. They are written in a more relaxed format and do not require formal review or approval.
### There are many such ERCs like -
- ERC20
- ERC1155
- ERC721
- ERC165 - standard interface for detection
- ERC4626 - Tokenized vaults
- ERC712 - standard data storing


### All ERCs are EIPs but all EIPs are not ERCs.
