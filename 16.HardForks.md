# Hard Forks

## A blockchain or protocol upgrade is a co-ordinated change to the rules that govern how the blockchain operates.
### These changes may include:
- #### Security improvements
- #### Capabilities of Smart Contracts
- #### Consensus mechanisms
- #### How transactions are processed
- #### Gas fee mechanisms

## All these changes occur when the chain is still active and the network is functioning normally. This ensures that the network remains secure and reliable during the upgrade process.

## Examples include when Ethereum upgraded from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism in 2022, The london upgrade, and the cancun upgrade.

## Sometimes community also disagrees to the changes proposed by the community, leading to forks in the blockchain. These forks can result in different versions of the blockchain, each with its own set of rules and features. Such as DAO fork in 2016. In 2016, an attacker stole 150 million dollars worth of Ether from the DAO smart contract. And community was split into two factions, one supporting the attacker and the other opposing him. This led to the creation of two different versions of the blockchain, each with its own set of rules and features. THey both are present even today called Ethereum(one which opposed the attacker) and Ethereum Classic.


# The hierarchy in Ethereum is in this was -
# Core Ethereum Developers , Node Operators , Applications Developers , Blockchain Users .
