# Use Cases

- Digital Money (BTC and ETH)
- Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
- Stablecoins -
    - USDC - 1 USDC is same as 1 USD, useful during inflation
    - Smart contracts
    - Cross border payments
    - Digital Ownership (certificate of ownership that cannot be forged or copied)
    - Access to financial services (some countries don't allow them, but blockchain can be used anywhere if u have mobile and internet)

- Governance (voting, decision making, etc.)
  - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) - Voting and results are completely deterministic and transparent.
  - More on it later

## Terminologies

DApp - Decentralized Application (apps built on blockchain instead of backend) - Website or mobile app
Web3 - Web3 is a decentralized web that uses blockchain technology to create a more secure and transparent internet.
(Web1 was static data, Web2 was dynamic data with decentralized applications, Web3 is decentralized applications)


# Addressing Common Concerns and Misconceptions

## As with any transformative technology, blockchain faces its share of skepticism. Here are answers to some of the most common concerns.

### "Isn't it just for criminals?"
#### While any tool, including cash and the internet, can be used for illicit activities, blockchain transactions are fundamentally public and traceable. This permanent, immutable record makes it a challenging tool for anonymous crime. The technology itself is neutral, and its positive impact—such as providing financial access to billions of unbanked people—vastly outweighs its potential for misuse.

### "Isn't it bad for the environment?"
#### This criticism is largely aimed at older blockchains like Bitcoin that use an energy-intensive consensus mechanism. However, the vast majority of modern blockchains are incredibly energy-efficient. After its major upgrade known as "The Merge," the Ethereum network now consumes significantly less energy than traditional banking systems and even large tech companies like Google or Netflix.

### "Isn't it too complicated for the average person?"
#### The underlying technology is complex, but the user experience is improving at a rapid pace. Most people use the internet every day without understanding the intricate protocols like TCP/IP that make it work. Similarly, you won't need to be a blockchain expert to use DApps. The industry is focused on abstracting away the complexity to create simple, intuitive applications for everyone.
