# History of Blockchains

We had Digicash as the first ever digital currency, but it failed as it was centralized and lacked scalability. This led to the development of decentralized systems like Bitcoin.

Digicash even had a Double-Spend Problem, which means that users could spend the same digital currency twice, leading to fraud and loss of trust in the system. This problem was solved by introducing a blockchain-based system. In order to solve this, Digicash had to introduce a centralized authority which failed due to trust issues.

This double spend problem is also called as Byzantine Generals Problem. (Google for more on it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance))

### This was solved by Bitcoin in Bitcoin white paper. Which had same rules for everyone, noone was discriminater.

### Then Ethereum was introduced by Vitalik Buterin in 2013. Ethereum introduced smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This allowed for the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and the development of new types of digital assets, such as tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

Smart contract is a contract that is written in Code, not in pen and paper or in a word document.

## Bitcoin is like a Calculator and Ethereum is like a Computer.
## Bitcoin is simple but less useful than Ethereum.
## Bitcoin is turing incomplete but Ethereum is Turing complete virtual machine.

# Benefits

- Permissionless
- Credibly Neutral (No discrimination at all)
- Decentralized
- Transparent
- Immutable
